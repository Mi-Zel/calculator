## Description

*After covid there will be lots of and companies who will have hybrid workplaces. Employees will work both from home and physically. Companies will have many partially used or unused offices. Our calculator will help you calculate the most optimal solution so you won't have unnecessary unused or half empty offices.*

*We learnd there are many challenges when working with backend. we had to write so many conditions for our project to work properly and without any bugs*

*We are proud of our algorithms and their use in our app. We are also proud of all of conditions we made so it looks good and says the right things and makes sense.*

## Next steps

*We are going to work on the looks of our App. We also need to fix small bug that coases that it maight in some cases calculate that you need more offices (1-3 (we think)) this bug occur only in Advanced Office Calculator and Unused Offices Calculator. we also plan to add more useful calculators and more advanced calculators*
